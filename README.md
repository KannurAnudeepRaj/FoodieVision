# FoodieVision Classifier

FoodieVision is a deep learning-based image classifier tailored for recognizing a variety of food items. This project can be seamlessly integrated into mobile applications, offering users nutritional information and suggesting recipes based on their food images.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KannurAnudeepRaj/FoodieVision-Classifier.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Classifier:**
   ```bash
   python foodie_vision.py path/to/your/food/image.jpg
   ```

## Model Details

- **Base Model:** VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input Size:** 224x224 pixels
- **Output:** Top 3 predicted food items with confidence scores

## Integration with Mobile App

To seamlessly integrate FoodieVision into your mobile app, consider using TensorFlow Lite for deploying the model on mobile devices. Refer to the TensorFlow Lite documentation for detailed instructions.

## Continuous Improvement

Regularly update the model with new food images to enhance recognition accuracy over time. This iterative process ensures that FoodieVision adapts to a diverse range of food images and provides accurate results.
